# S2C2F Level 3 Compliance Documentation

This document details how our Harbor implementation meets the requirements of S2C2F Level 3 maturity.

## S2C2F Level 3 Requirements

Level 3 represents "comprehensive governance of OSS components" and focuses on proactive security measures and segregation of software until it's been properly tested and secured. At this level, the organization demonstrates mature security practices including:

- Complete software inventory
- Artifact signing enforcement
- Vulnerability scanning and remediation
- Network isolation and segmentation
- Comprehensive access controls
- Audit logging and monitoring

## Compliance Matrix

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Artifact Signing Enforcement | Implemented using Harbor Notary with mandatory signing policy for production artifacts | ✅ Compliant |
| Vulnerability Scanning | Integrated Trivy scanner with automatic scanning on push and scheduled scans | ✅ Compliant |
| Image Promotion Workflow | Multi-stage promotion workflow from dev → staging → production with increasing security requirements | ✅ Compliant |
| Network Segmentation | Network policies restrict communication between namespaces and external resources | ✅ Compliant |
| RBAC Implementation | Azure AD integration with RBAC for fine-grained access control | ✅ Compliant |
| Secrets Management | Azure Key Vault integration with AKS CSI driver for secure secrets management | ✅ Compliant |
| Audit Logging | Comprehensive logging to Azure Log Analytics with 365-day retention | ✅ Compliant |
| Encrypted Storage | All storage encrypted with customer-managed keys | ✅ Compliant |
| Secure Networking | Private endpoints for all Azure PaaS services in production | ✅ Compliant |
| High Availability | Multi-zone deployment for production environment | ✅ Compliant |

## Security Controls

### Network Security

Our Harbor implementation employs multiple layers of network security:

1. **Virtual Network Isolation**: Harbor components are deployed in dedicated subnets with restricted communication paths
2. **Network Security Groups**: Granular traffic control between components
3. **Private Endpoints**: All Azure PaaS services use private endpoints in production
4. **Kubernetes Network Policies**: Pod-to-pod communication restrictions
5. **Ingress Controller**: HTTPS-only access with TLS termination
6. **Web Application Firewall**: Azure Front Door WAF protects Harbor endpoints

### Identity and Access Management

The solution implements a comprehensive IAM strategy:

1. **Azure AD Integration**: Authentication through Azure AD
2. **RBAC**: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
3. **Service Accounts**: Managed identities for Azure services
4. **Just-in-Time Access**: Privileged Identity Management for admin access
5. **Conditional Access**: Enforced MFA for administrative actions

### Data Protection

Data is protected both at rest and in transit:

1. **Encryption at Rest**: All storage components encrypted with customer-managed keys
2. **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
3. **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation policy
4. **Secrets Management**: Azure Key Vault with controlled access

### Vulnerability Management

Comprehensive vulnerability management includes:

1. **Image Scanning**: Trivy scanner integrated with Harbor
2. **Scan on Push**: Automatic scanning when images are pushed
3. **Scheduled Scans**: Daily rescanning of all artifacts
4. **Vulnerability Policies**: Configurable blocking based on severity
5. **CVE Allowlisting**: Controlled process for managing exceptions

### Artifact Signing

Secure artifact management with:

1. **Notary Integration**: Content trust through Notary
2. **Signing Requirements**: Mandatory signing for production artifacts
3. **Key Management**: Secure storage of signing keys
4. **Verification**: Runtime verification of signatures

## Auditing and Compliance Monitoring

Our monitoring setup ensures continuous compliance:

1. **Azure Monitor**: Centralized monitoring solution
2. **Log Analytics**: Aggregated logs with 365-day retention
3. **Alert Policies**: Automated alerts for compliance violations
4. **Compliance Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into compliance status
5. **Security Center**: Integration with Azure Security Center
6. **Audit Workflow**: Documented process for compliance review

### Audit Logging

The following audit logs are collected and retained:

- AKS API server logs
- AKS audit logs
- Harbor API access logs
- Harbor administrative action logs
- Container registry access logs
- Database query logs
- Azure activity logs
- Key Vault access logs

### Retention Policy

- Production logs: 365 days
- Staging logs: 180 days
- Development logs: 90 days

## Regular Assessment

1. **Quarterly Security Reviews**: Documented assessment of compliance status
2. **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party penetration testing
3. **Vulnerability Assessments**: Monthly automated vulnerability scanning
4. **Configuration Drift Detection**: Continuous monitoring of infrastructure state

## Incident Response

1. **Defined Procedures**: Documented incident response procedures
2. **Automated Alerts**: Real-time alerting for security events
3. **Escalation Path**: Clear escalation process for security incidents
4. **Containment Strategy**: Procedures for containing security breaches
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Required review process after incidents
